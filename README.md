PassLok Privacy
===============

PassLok is a toolkit that implements public key cryptography and steganography to supplement ANY communications program.

These are the principles guiding the design of PassLok:
* Perfect portability. Runs on any computer or mobile device.
* Completely self-contained so it runs offline. No servers.
* Nothing should be installed. No required secrets saved.
* Highest-level security at every step. No compromises.
* Easy to understand and use by novices. Graphical interface, as clean and simple as possible. No crypto jargon.

Because of this, PassLok is pure html code consisting mostly of JavaScript instructions. Its cryptography code is based on Tweet NaCl, also on GitHub. It uses XSalsa20 for symmetric encryption and elliptic curves (Curve25519 and Ed25519) for public-key functions.

PassLok was started as URSA, also by F. Ruiz, and developed privately up to version 1.3.03, made on 8/15/13. Commits on GitHub began seriously with this version. The engine was based on the SJCL library up to version 2.1.03, which has been forked out on this repository in order to preserve it.

These are the open source libraries used in PassLok, which can be found in the js-opensrc directory:
* Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme. Edited so NaCl RNG is used instead of built-in RNG: https://github.com/amper5and/secrets.js
* For hiding data in images: https://github.com/petereigenschink/steganography.js
* FastClick, used only in mobile devices: https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick
* Tweet NaCl in JavaScript: https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js
* ed2curve-js conversion of curve coordinates: https://github.com/dchest/ed2curve-js
* SCRYPT key stretching, edited to make it synchronous. https://github.com/dchest/scrypt-async-js
* Reed-Solomon error correction: https://github.com/louismullie/erc-js
* lz-string compression algorithm: https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string
* Markov chain text steganography. Edited RegEx: https://github.com/jthuraisamy/markovTextStego.js

The PassLok original code is in directories js-head and js-body:
* this only loads two word arrays: wordlist and blacklist: dictionary_en.js
* Key and Lock functions: KeyLock.js
* cryptographic functions: crypto.js
* extra functions for mail, etc.: extra.js
* error correction functions: errorCorrection.js
* Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme: SSSS.js
* text and image steganograghy: stego.js
* local Directory functions: localdir.js
* functions for switching screens, etc.: switching.js
* special functions that work only with Chrome apps and extensions: Chromestuff.js
* window reformatting, special functions: bodyscript.js
* initialization, button connections: initbuttons.js

Two components run inside iframes and are served from different sources. They are not included here because we use Phonegap so generate automatically some versions from this repo, and they should not contain that code. Those components are:
* PassLok General Directory: https://github.com/fruiz500/PassLok-GenDir
* PassLok Chat: https://github.com/fruiz500/PassLok-Chat
