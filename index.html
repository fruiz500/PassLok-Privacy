    <h3>What is PassLok?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>Before you do anything else, you may want to watch this three-minute video, which explains the essential concepts in a lighthearted way (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok locks text and files, and sets up secure real time chat sessions using strong <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>.</li>
      <li>PassLok is based on Keys and Locks. You encrypt something with <strong>someone else's Lock</strong>, so only that person can decrypt it with his/her Key.</li>
      <li>Your Key is a short piece of text, which <strong>can be anything you want so you can remember it</strong>.</li>
      <li>The matching Lock is then made from your Key. It is impossible to get the Key or your email from the Lock.</li>
      <li>You should never give your Key to anyone. Your Lock, however, is meant to be distributed freely, like a phone number.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach has a number of advantages over other privacy apps that you may be familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok does not involve a server, so nobody can possibly have your private data.</li>
      <li>The same code runs on computers, phones, and tablets to make it perfectly portable.</li>
      <li>You can use PassLok with your favorite email, texting app, or any program by cut and paste.</li>
      <li>PassLok does not need to store anything secret. The only secret is your Key, which stays in your head.</li>
      <li>You can use PassLok with a public or borrowed device as easily and safely as with your private phone or computer.</li>
      <li>Several users (or several identities) can coexist on the same device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PassLok is <strong>still in experimental phase</strong> since there has not been enough time for security experts to uncover possible flaws. Bear this in mind before entrusting critical secrets to it.</p>
    <p>If you find PassLok too difficult, you may want to try SeeOnce instead, from <a href="https://passlok.com/seeonce" target="_blank">https://passlok.com/seeonce</a>. <strong>SeeOnce</strong> implements the Read-once mode of PassLok plus one type of text hiding, but you never have to worry about maintaining a directory of Locks. Even easier is <strong>URSA</strong>, available at <a href="https://passlok.com/ursa" target="_blank">https://passlok.com/ursa</a>, which includes only the shared Key mode of PassLok. Finally, there's <strong>PassLok for Email</strong>, an extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-for-email/ehakihemolfjgbbfhkbjgahppbhecclh" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-for-email/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> that integrates with popular email services (currently Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook), and <strong>PassLok Universal</strong>, very similar to PassLok for Email, but not restricted to any email service; these are its links for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-universal/lbmlbnfgnbfppkfijbbpnecpglockled" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-universal/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. All of these apps are fully compatible with PassLok, although they may not be compatible with each other.</p>
    <p>And if you don't, you may want to try the <strong>PassLok Privacy</strong> extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, which is almost identical to this standalone app, except that it syncs seamlessly between computers and is impervious to other extensions that might be running on the browser. Finally, the whole PassLok Privacy is part of the <strong>FusionKey</strong> extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fusionkey/legnppmlegkibpinfjodjbejohblaaam" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fusionkey/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, which integrates with any email service (not just the Big Three) and also includes the <strong>SynthPass</strong> password manager.</p>

    <h3>Invite others to PassLok</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>Before you can communicate with others using PassLok, they must have obtained the app, come up with a secret Key (which they won't tell you), generated a Lock from it, and sent it back to you.</p>
    <p>You can tell others about PassLok any way you want, but PassLok can help you to start your network with a single keystroke, this way:</p>
    <p>1. Optionally, type a message in the main box. Don't write anything sensitive, since <strong>invitation messages are not secure</strong>.</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Invite</strong> button. If nothing was written, a QR code will appear containing your Lock and a link to the app at passlok.com. You may want to stand by in order to guide people who scan the code through their initial set-up. Tap it to hide it.</p>
    <p>3. If something was written, you will be asked to confirm, and then a new page should open in your default email, containing a link to PassLok that includes your personal Lock plus your encrypted message and a short set of instructions. Edit it as needed, then write the recipients' email addresses and send it.</p>
    <p>This is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64</a></p>

    <div class="helpText">
      <p>The QR code and the invitation link load the web version of PassLok, but pasting the message into any other version of PassLok, or opening the email in PassLok for Email, PassLok Universal, FusionKey, or SeeOnce works just as well. Invitations made in those apps can also be opened in PassLok Privacy.</p>
      <p>Those who get PassLok from your QR code or email invitation will have your Lock automatically stored in their directories, so they can encrypt items for you right away.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>PassLok opens with the default Light colors. You can also select the Dark, Red, Green, and Blue schemes on the <strong>Options</strong> tab, or even make your own custom scheme, this way:</p>
    <p>1. Click Custom on <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
    <p>2. Select the  color you wish to modify: Tabs, Background, Buttons, or Boxes.</p>
    <p>3. Click the colored box, which will open a selector. Hue and saturation are set on the main area, brightness on the sidebar.</p>
    <p>4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each color type.</p>
    <p>PassLok will pick random colors if you click the <strong>Random</strong> button. You can then edit them using the selector.</p>

  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>How to make a strong Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>You should be able to <strong>remember your secret Key</strong> without having to write it down. PassLok does not store the Key anywhere. In fact, it deletes it from memory after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p>As you type your Key, PassLok displays a color-coded message telling you how strong it is. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic &quot;Hashili&quot; word based on your Key is displayed right under the strength score, to reassure you that you have typed the Key correctly, even if you cannot see it. Clicking the eye icon reveals the entire Key.</p>
    <p>Your Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places, <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>miespell</strong> them to make harder a "dictionary attack." Break the words up with <strong>num334bers</strong> and <strong>sy#$%mbols</strong>. Avoid anything that might be easy to guess. PassLok knows frequently used words, but hackers' dictionaries are bigger. Do not use grammatically correct sentences, even if PassLok gives a big score.</p>
    <p>PassLok <strong>compensates for weak Keys by adding spurious computations</strong> and may even appear to have crashed. If PassLok is slow, this may be because your Key strength is less than Medium.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0</a></p>

    <div class="helpText">
      <p>If you plan to use PassLok only with shared Keys, you do not need a secret Key at all. Simply Cancel when you are asked for your Key when PassLok starts, and write or paste the encryption Key into the lower box that appears when you you click the <strong>Edit</strong> button located next to the directory.</p>
      <p>If instead of a short shared Key you paste in a piece or text at least five times as long as the message to be encrypted, PassLok uses it in Pad mode, which theoretically is much more secure than the regular mode (more on this in a help item below).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Get a hint to remember my Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>If you are reading this, likely you have gained Guest access to PassLok by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> at the Key entry screen. The good news is that you can still encrypt messages if you know the recipient's Lock or shared Key, verify signatures, and use the Locks stored in your local directory as well as all the auxiliary functions of PassLok. You can even seal items and display the matching Lock if you enter a Key when PassLok asks for it.</p>
    <p>The bad news is that  you cannot change anything stored in the local directory, and your use of it is limited to Locks. You cannot do anything that would involve your secret Key, such as decrypting messages encrypted with your Lock, or continuing a Read-once conversation in course.</p>
    <p>Well, we've got even worse news for you: we cannot help you to recover your secret Key, because PassLok never stored it or sent it out. There are no saved hints, either. If you forgot your Key, <strong>it's gone, along with all encrypted items in the local directory</strong>.</p>
    <p>But chances are you <em>almost</em> remember it, and are off by a few characters only. If you click the eye icon, a mnemonic &quot;Hashili&quot; word derived from it appears right above it. Perhaps you can recognize the correct Hashili word when you see it, which will help you to reconstruct your Key. For your security, the Hashili word alone is not enough to reconstruct the Key.</p>

    <div class="helpText">
      <p>Hopefully Guest mode will let you get by until you remember your secret Key. But if you want to get full access to PassLok with a new Key, here are the steps:</p>
      <p>1. Go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>2. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> box. When a popup asks for confirmation to delete your settings, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
      <p>3. Reload PassLok.</p>
      <p>4. The user selection screen will appear, and this time PassLok will accept whatever new Key and email or suchlike you want to give it for the user in question. Now you're back in business and can use PassLok with the new Key to seal, decrypt, store items in the local directory, etc.</p>
      <p>At this point, the only directory entry that will work fully is &quot;myself&quot;. You can reset or delete the entries that don't work one by one, by typing each name in the directory Edit dialog and clicking <strong>Reset</strong> (leave essential data intact) or <strong>Delete</strong> (take out everything) when the name is recognized, or all at once by following the process described in a help item below, about &quot;moving the entire local directory.&quot;</p>

    <h3>Use a different Key temporarily</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>For a given user name, there is only one &quot;secret Key&quot; that unlocks all the capabilities of PassLok, but if you are willing to accept a limited access to its functions, you can use a different Key for the session, or whenever PassLok asks you for the Key. This way:</p>
    <p>1. Select the user and enter the new Key in the box (optional).</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p>
    <p>3. If asked for your email etc., enter it and click <strong>OK</strong>. (the <strong>Random</strong> button will write a new random value, different from the original random token, if any, so beware)</p>
    <div class="helpHeading2">
      <p><em>Click here for More:</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>You can do pretty much everything, except things that would have involved the secret Key. You cannot modify anything in the local directory. When you reload PassLok and enter the correct Key, a warning will tell you that last session was run in Guest mode. If you don't select a user from the list, you won't have access to any stored Locks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Make PassLok even more secure</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>When you first opened PassLok, you were asked to optionally enter your email or similar public, easy to recall personal information. But if instead of entering your email you click the <strong>Random</strong> button next to the input box, an 43-character random token is used. This makes your Lock  much harder to crack, but it becomes tied to the device where it was created  (except for the Chrome and Firefox extensions, which can sync it across devices).</p>
    <p>To back up your random token to a safe place in case of accidental deletion or to be able to use a different device:</p>
    <p>1. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> button on the <strong>Options</strong> tab (visible in the Advanced interface). A backup item bracketed by &quot;PL**bak&quot; tags appears on the main box, from where you can save it to file, copy it, email it, etc.</p>
    <p>2. Then a dialog asks you if you want to reset your settings. If you click <strong>OK</strong>, PassLok will restart as if it had never started before, except that the local directory remains intact.</p>
    <p>To restore the random token from a backup item, paste the packup into the main box and click <strong>Decrypt</strong>.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM</a></p>
    <div class="helpHeading2">
      <p><em>Click here for More:</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>The reason for the email or other additional data is to combat the &quot;rainbow table&quot; attack, where hackers pre-compute Locks made from the words in a dictionary. This data is encrypted and stored along with other settings, so you won't need to enter it again. The Lock depends both on the Key and the email or random token; this adds extra security, but it also means that if the random token gets erased you will not be able to decrypt anything that was encrypted with your Lock. The backup item contains your settings, including the random token, double-encrypted by your secret Key. One reason to delete your settings while leaving the local directory intact is to be able to change the random token to a new value. You can also proceed without entering any email or token.</p>
      <p>If you plan to use both PassLok and PassLok for Email or PassLok Universal, it is best if you write your real email in this box, for in this case your PassLok Lock will be identical to the one used in those apps and you'll be able to use their main features interchangeably. This precaution is not necessary if you only use one of the versions.</p>

    <h3>Display the Lock matching your secret Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>Click the <strong>myLock</strong> button on the <strong>Main</strong> tab. The Lock matching that Key will appear
      in the lower box, from where you can copy it or email it.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Invite</strong> button with nothing displayed in the main box, and then a Lock-containing QR code will appear that others can scan with mobile devices. Tap it to make it go away.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L00yybDzN6k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L00yybDzN6k</a></p>

      <p>By default, PassLok displays the Lock in ezLok format, consisting of 50 lowercase letters (except L) and numbers, so you can easily dictate it if necessary. On the <strong>Options</strong> tab, you can change this to Word format, consisting of 20 common words, or to base64 format like all other PassLok items, consisting of 43 numbers, letters (capital and smallcase) and special characters / or +<strong></strong>. PassLok for Email, PassLok Universal, and FusionKey are compatible with all Lock formats, but SeeOnce is compatible only with ezLoks. If you wrote your real email when asked about it in the initial wizard, rather than something else, then your Lock is the same as that used in those apps, and the encrypted items made by any flavor of PassLok can be decrypted in the other apps. This precaution is not necessary for SeeOnce.</p>
      <p>If you need to make a Lock for a different Key (for instance, in order to receive hidden messages), it is best if you start PassLok in Guest mode by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> when you are first asked for your Key, which will make PassLok accept a different Key. Then click <strong>myLock</strong> and supply the new Key and your email, if requested (if you use a random token you will need to copy it before, by  clicking Change Email in Options).</p>

    <div class="helpText">
      <p>1. Check that the item to be converted into fake text is on the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Then click the <strong>&#9660;</strong> button, if needed, to show the <strong>Text hide</strong> button.</p>
      <p>2. If you wish to use a cover text different from the default and you have stored it in the local directory, select it on the top box of the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Otherwise click the <strong>Edit</strong> button and enter the new cover text in the dialog, then return to the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>3. Make sure the hiding mode you want is the one selected in the <strong>Options</strong> tab. There are five different modes: Invisible, Letters, Words, Spaces, and Sentences. Letters (default) encodes the item as identical-looking non-ASCII characters in the cover text. Words replaces each character by two words. Spaces encodes the characters into the spaces between words. Sentences encodes characters as grammatically correct sentences. Invisible mode encodes into invisible characters between two lines, which can then be completed to look like a normal message.</p>
      <p>4. If now you click the <strong>Text hide</strong> button, the PassLok item is converted into text, using words from the cover text. You may have to complete the last sentence manually.</p>

        <p>The recipient does not need to have the cover text in order to retrieve the original. The output of Spaces and Sentences encoding is roughly six times longer than that of Letters or Words encoding. The most grammatically-correct output is that or Letters and Spaces (identical to the cover text), followed by Sentences; Words output doesn't make much grammatical sense. Invisible encoding has no impact on intelligibility, but care must be taken to copy the entire invisible content. If the cover text is not long enough, it will be repeated several times. When you use Spaces or Letters encoding, you should be careful not to add or delete any spaces within the encoded text, but it is okay to add a few extra letters to complete the last sentence. Also be aware that some services replace the special characters in Letters- and Invisible-encoded items with something else, thus corrupting the items.</p>
        <p>Text encoding is no substitute for real encryption, and so PassLok will refuse to convert into text anything that does not look like genuine PassLok output.</p>
        <p>Cover texts do not have to be in English or even use Latin characters. Anything that can be written in UTF-16 encoded characters can be used (most languages, including Arabic and Chinese, will work fine).</p>

      <p>2. Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the directory box, and write or paste the other item in the dialog that appears.</p>
      <p>3. Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button. The Key and the Lock will merge and the 43-character result, which is itself a valid Lock, is placed in both the dialog and the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EImhN35Tbs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EImhN35Tbs</a></p>

        <p>If both items or neither of them is a valid Lock, the merging process fails and a message is displayed. The result of combining your secret Key and someone's Lock is itself a Lock, and the same as that of combining your Lock and that person's secret Key. You can combine a set of Keys into one by first making the Lock of one of them, and then combining the other Keys, one after the other, as described above. The order of entering the Keys does not matter.</p>

      <h3>Ask the participants in a Chat session to authenticate themselves <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>1. Inside the chat session, type a bunch of garbage. You should expect  the garbage back as a sealed item from each participant who has not yet done so.</p>
      <p>2. When a sealed item is posted in the chat session, copy it  and go back to the <strong>Main</strong> tab of PassLok, then paste it there.</p>
      <p>3. In the local directory, select the Lock belonging to the person who posted the signature, and click the <strong>Unseal</strong> button.</p>
      <p>4. The original garbage string should be recovered, plus a message indicating that the sealer has been verified. If the seal is verified, this means that the one who posted it is indeed who he/she claims to be.</p>
      <p>This is all explained in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlEJJpF-Wmo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlEJJpF-Wmo</a></p>

        <p>This process assumes that the Locks in your local directory have been authenticated, perhaps by following the process explained elsewhere in the help area. When asking others to authenticate themselves, it is important to ensure that the text they are asked to seal could not have been predicted ahead of time.</p>
        <p>If there is no Lock for a participant, but rather a shared Key, he/she should instead encrypt the garbage text with that shared Key and post the result. Authentication will be complete once the encrypted text can be decrypted with the shared Key and the result matches the original.</p>

      <h3>Authenticate a Lock without using videos <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>The easy way: call the Lock's owner and ask him/her to read  a substantial portion of the Lock over the phone. But if you are communicating exclusively by email you can send a person whom you know and who knows you the following message, or something like it:</p>
      <p><br>
        <em>Dear So-and-So:</em><br>
        <em>I just obtained your PassLok Lock from (cite source), but I still wonder if it is authentic since I am unable to view the authenticating video. Therefore, I ask you to help me authenticate it through the interlock protocol. Here's what I want you to do:</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Write a message asking me to take a picture or video of myself doing something of your choice. Encrypt the message with my Lock, which is appended to this message, and copy it to a safe place. Then split it in two and send me the first half only.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I receive your first half, I will also write a message asking you to do something in a picture or short video. I'll encrypt that message with your Lock, and I'll send you half of the encrypted message first. When you get it, go ahead and send me the other half of your encrypted message.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I get your second half, I'll put the two halves together and decrypt your message. Then, following your instructions I'll send you the picture or video right away, decrypted, along with the second half of my encrypted request.</em></li>
        <li><em>When you get it, please verify that what I sent conforms to your instructions. If so, put together the two halves of my encrypted message to you, decrypt it, and send me what I ask in the message as soon as possible, decrypted as well. Then I'll know that your Lock is authentic.</em></li>
      </ol>

        <p>Alternatively, you can ask the other person to use PassLok's built-in <strong>Split/Join</strong> function, explained in another help item, rather than simply cutting messages in two.  The pictures or videos (or recordings) don't need to be encrypted. Only the instructions for making them need to be encrypted and transmitted with this two-step process. There is an article in the <a href="http://passlok.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/1/8/24187628/passlok_manual21.pdf" target="_blank">PassLok manual</a> that explains how this protocol works for authenticating Locks.</p>

    <h3>Check the authenticity of the code</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>If you got PassLok from an app store, that app store is ensuring that the code you have is what the author gave to them. The following is to check the integrity of the web app version of PassLok running in a browser:</p>
    <p>1. Direct your browser to "view source." If your browser has a command to save the source (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari do), go ahead and save it to file. Alternatively, you can go to Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator) and type the URL of your version of PassLok there, then skip step 2.</p>
    <p>2. Now you have to take the SHA256 checksum of the code (or the MD5 or SHA1 checksums) using a program different from PassLok. You have several options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a local program or online utility to take the checksum of the source saved to a file.</li>
      <li>Use an online utility where you paste the text on a box and click a button. You must make sure that pasting does not add extra space at the top or the bottom of the file, which would affect the result.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Look up the checksum for this version of PassLok, which is published on the PassLok information website at passlok.weebly.com and a number of other places. If this value and the one obtained above are not the same, the program has been tampered with. Here are some places where this information is published:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok information page: <a href="https://passlok.weebly.com/get-passlok.html" target="_blank">https://passlok.weebly.com/get-passlok.html</a></li>
      <li>PR Gomez.com (author's blog): <a href="https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-passlok" target="_blank">https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-passlok/</a></li>
      <li>Chrome extension description: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh</a></li>
      <li>Firefox addon description: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/</a></li>
      <li>Android app description: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fruiz500.passlok" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fruiz500.passlok</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. Now, a hacker who could alter the source code at the server might also be able to change the published checksums so they match the tampered code. To make sure that the value is authentic you should watch the one-minute video where the author or PassLok, Francisco Ruiz, reads the SHA256 checksum aloud. A link to the video usually accompanies the published SHA256 value.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY</a></p>

    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>Typically, you load the source on a separate tab by typing CTRL-U (Windows) or option-cmd-u (OSX). Another way to save the source is to copy it by first selecting the the whole source code (CTRL-A or cmd-a), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-C or cmd-c), and then paste it into a text editor (CTRL-V or cmd-v), and save it from there. DO NOT save the code using the "save" command when the working PassLok page is displayed, since then the browser would modify the source code before saving it. The correct encoding is UTF-8, no BOM (notes: Windows Notepad is unable to save text in the correct format. Cut and paste from Chrome introduces artifacts for big items like the source code).</p>
      <p>SHA256 is built into the OS in Linux and OSX, not so in Windows, but there are free programs available, such as Checksum Utility and Bitser. There are also online utilities where you can upload a file and get the hash. Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator), fileformat.info (http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm) and freeformatter.com (https://www.freeformatter.com/sha256-generator.html) have worked well in our tests.</p>
      <p>If you want a clipboard-based SHA256 utility, the one at Xorbin (https://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) has worked quite well in our tests. Don't copy and paste from Chrome, since this introduces artifacts.</p>

    <p><strong>Data we collect:</strong> Nothing. No cookies or anything of that sort. We don't even have the means to know who has downloaded the app.</p>
    <p><strong>How we use this data:</strong> Nothingness brings us closer to Nirvana. It's quite a liberation.</p>
    <p><strong>What data we share:</strong> Everything we have from you, that is, absolutely nothing. This way we don't need expensive servers and our bills are small, plus we cannot compromise your precious data. Here's wishing that so many other providers would do likewise.</p>
    <p>Concerning truly private data:</p>
    <p><strong>1. We cannot give your secret Key to anyone</strong> (not even yourself) because we don't have it. Your Key is never stored or transmitted, and by default gets deleted from memory  after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p><strong>2. We cannot give your private data to anyone</strong> because PassLok does not send anything out of your device. When you download the app from its server, you get only the code, without any cookies, plugins, or anything of that sort.</p>
    <p><strong>3. We cannot eavesdrop on your chat sessions, or enable anyone to do so.</strong> Establishing a chat session does involve contacting a signaling server and giving it your IP address and a disposable chatroom name so that others can contact you; the signaling server never sees the content of your chat, which is between participants only. The PassLok web server doesn't even see the connection data.</p>
    <p><strong>4. We will never weaken the cryptography methods contained within PassLok at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We would rather shut down PassLok than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of our efforts. If we learn that counterfeit versions of PassLok are circulating, whether placed by hackers or government agencies, we will make the fact known to users.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Since PassLok is distributed as a piece of human-readable code, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of PassLok, whether by individuals or public entities, violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
    <p>PassLok contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal to use in some countries. Please check the local laws before using PassLok.</p>

    <p>This paragraph and the canary logo above attest to the fact that, up until the release of PassLok version 2.5.4 (May 2023) we have not received any requests under gag order for user data or modifications of the code. This paragraph will be periodically updated as this situation continues.</p>

    <p>You will get better security if you also provide some public piece of data about yourself, such as your email address. This is case sensitive. There's no risk of spam since nothing will be sent out. You can skip this if you want.</p>

    <p>When you click the button below, the random-looking Lock matching your secret Key will appear on PassLok's Main screen, along with some further instructions. You want to send that Lock to your friends so they can send you encrypted messages. You can do this any time by clicking the Email button or just by clicking the checkbox below.</p>
    <p>You will start in Basic mode, which shows only the most essential functions. If you are looking for more features, go to the Options tab and check the Advanced checkbox. There is also Email mode, which makes this app fully compatible with <em>PassLok for Email</em>.</p>
